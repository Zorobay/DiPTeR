## Setup

### Install dependencies

Python dependencies can be installed from the `environment.yaml` file using conda. However, I've had problems installing from this format before, so as an alternative, install
 from the `env.txt` file instead using `conda env create --file env.txt`.
  
### Glumpy and freetype
In order for `glumpy` to work, `freetype` is needed. To install it on Windows, you can download the `freetype.dll` from 
[HERE](https://github.com/ubawurinna/freetype-windows-binaries/blob/master/win64/freetype.dll). You then need to set the `FT_Library_filename` variable in `glumpy/ext/freetype
/__init__.py` to point to this `.dll`...

For Anaconda users, this folder is usually located in `C:/Users/<username>/<Anaconda3 or miniconda3>/envs/DiPTer/Lib/site-packages`
